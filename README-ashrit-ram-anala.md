# Geo-Bet

Geo-Bet is a web application that allows users to create user accounts with authentication and answer geography questions with a casino-esque twist. Each question can be bet on (in game coins) and the user gains or loses the amount they bet based on their answer. A leaderboard shows the top scorers so that users can compete to be the best geography player (and gambler).
