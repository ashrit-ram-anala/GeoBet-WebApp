# Reflection

I had limited experience with **React**, **Node**, and **Express** going into this and no experience with **Tailwind CSS** and the **DaisyUI** component library or **MongoDB** and **Firebase** so the goals I had set for the project were a bit daunting initially. I took the process step by step and put everything else I had to do to the side to deal with when i got to it and I think that's what really helped me finish everything I wanted. I watched videos and tutorials for the technologies I didn't know too well and managed to complete the project with everything working as intended for the most part, which i was happy with. The frontend code wasn't too different from regular logic so it wasn't bad to write, the backend was what was a bit intimidating as I had no clue how CRUD operations worked and how to fetch and put. After a few YouTube videos, though, this turned out to be not as bad as I thought it would be, albeit this application is fairly simple. The main thing I was actually unable to do was separate and organize my files into components in the frontend and different folders like routes, models, and controllers in the backend. I separated the individual pages but I wasn't too sure of how to properly interconnect components and how to organize the project so I ended up doing the entire game logic in one file when i should have split it up, so that's something I definitely have to improve on. One thing i wanted to do but didn't have time to was work with Docker. I've heard of it and I've wanted to try it out and see the use cases, but I didn't have enough time to fully test it out and see how it works with this project. Another thing I wanted to do but din't have enough time for was setting up a proper username system since I was unable to get the username from firebase as I used the anonymous authentication system. I would have loved to make a proper leaderboard with mongoDB and associated users with their scores, but just didn't have enough time to do so. One thing I wanted to try and will try is deploying this project. I've deployed projects to the web before but they did not have a proper backend, so I'd like to see how that works for this. I've heard I should deploy the frontend of Vercel and backend on Heroku but I'll have to see how this entire process works first

# Geo-Bet

Geo-Bet is a web application that allows users to create user accounts with authentication and answer geography questions with a casino-esque twist. Each question can be bet on (in game coins) and the user gains or loses the amount they bet based on their answer. A leaderboard shows the top scorers so that users can compete to be the best geography player (and gambler).
